Policy Problem: The Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) in Nova Scotia (NS) is projecting a 9.7% tax increase, primarily via property taxes in the upcoming budget scheduled for release in April 2024. This analysis is at the request of the Unnamed Advocacy Group (UAG), which opposes the November 2023 Police Board Proposal to add 24 new personnel, 22 of whom are police staff, at a cost of $4 million to the 2024/25 budget. HRM is consequently proposing a 6.3% increase in the police budget, amounting to $5,787,100 citing population increase. Despite the opposition from nearly 40 people at the police board meeting, the police and city officials believe increasing police staff is necessary to maintain public safety and reduce crime in the H.R.M. This analysis examines the data around crime and policing.
